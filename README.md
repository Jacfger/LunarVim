# Intro
This is the forked version of the LunarVim.

# Plugins

## Bunch of them from https://github.com/indianBoy42

## LaTex-Related

  - HyperSnips: Self explanatory. Great Plug in and very well written snips. Gilles Castel, much appreciated.

  - Vimtex: Yes. This plug-in would conflict with tree-sitter. Vimtex will be unable to detect math mode with it activated. Therefore, tree-sitter is disabled for tex files.

    - I turned conceal all the way up :D ðŸ¤­

## ToDo: 

  - Python.
  - Not so much but C++. But probably handled by others.
